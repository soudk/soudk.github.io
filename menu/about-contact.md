<h3 id="about">About me</h3>

Hi! I'm Soud, the owner of this site. I'm currently a graduate student at McGill University.

This website is really just a collection of thoughts, and overviews of recurring discussions I've had with my friends, family, and all sorts of other people. I am not a writer, nor am I expert on any of the of the topics I will write about here, so take everything you find on this site with a grain of my favourite salt: GdCl<sub>3</sub>.

#### About the site
I wanted to play around with Github Pages, Markdown-to-HTML, and Jekyll so I based this site off of <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange" target="_blank">LeNPaul's "Lagrange" theme</a> to start.

Got any feedback, questions, or comments?

Want to start a discussion? Something more?

Feel free to email me at:&emsp;<a href="mailto:soudkharusi+blog@gmail.com">soudkharusi+blog@gmail.com</a>

You can find out more about who I am by going over to my <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~soudal" target="_blank">professional/science website</a>.
