### About me and this blog

Hi! I'm Soud. I'm currently a physics graduate student at McGill University in Canada.

This blog page is really just a collection of thoughts, and overviews of recurring discussions I've had with all sorts of friends, family and people. I am not a writer, nor am I expert on any of these topics, so take everything you find here with a grain of my favourite salt: GdCl<sub>3</sub>.


### Contact

Got any feedback, questions, or comments?
