### About me

Hi! I'm Soud. I'm currently a physics graduate student at McGill University in Canada.

This blog site is really just a collection of thoughts, and overviews of recurring discussions I've had with my friends, family, and all sorts of other people. I am not a writer, nor am I expert on any of the of the topics I will write about here, so take everything you find on this site with a grain of my favourite salt: GdCl<sub>3</sub>.

#### About the site
I wanted to play around with Github Pages, Markdown to HTML, and Jekyll so I based this site off of LeNPaul's "Lagrange" Jekyll theme to start. We'll see how far I get with modifications, it's already quite good...
