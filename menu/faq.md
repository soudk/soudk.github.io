<h3 id="faq-blog">Why a blog?</h3>

I chose to make this site mainly for the freedom of expression. There are no ties to "likes" or "subscribers" just words on a screen. No notifications, no tags, and _especially_ no ads. Nothing but words, hyperlinks, and the occasional image.
 
HTML is the modern equivalent of a  pen and paper, <a href="/journal/digital-canvas.html">a digital canvas</a>. And it's super awesome how, given enough effort, you can do _whatever_ you want on your own webpage. It's a massive time sink, but really fun to do so I would encourage you all to try it out!

<h3 id="faq-share">Why'd you share this with me?</h3>

Probably because I thought you'd find it fun or interesting, or because we talked about something that I referenced/will reference here. 

<h3 id="faq-subscribe">How can I subscribe?</h3>

Shoot me an email with "Sign Me Up!" in the subject and I'll add you to a mailing list, please use <a href="mailto:soudkharusi+blog@gmail.com">soudkharusi+blog@gmail.com</a>

Alternative methods: 
* If you're like me and subscribe to RSS feeds, then click the RSS button at the top/bottom of pages. Add the newly openned URL to your RSS reader or news aggregator. New posts will show up there. 

* If you're on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S57uhCQBEk0" target="_blank">the Fediverse </a> then you can follow me on Mastodon <a href="https://social.privacytools.io/@soudk" rel="me" target="_blank">@soudk@social.privacytools.io</a>. If you'd like to join the same Mastodon instance as me, contact me for an invite link :) 

<h3 id="faq-mainsite">Why isn't this on your main site?</h3>

I wanted to (at least partially) separate my professional self from my personal thoughts. Plus, this way I get to try out some new web designs and learn some new tech.  

<h3 id="faq-public">Why is this stuff public?</h3>

I assume I am not the only one thinking about these things, and there are definitely other like-minded people out there in the world whether or not I know them in person. Going a bit further, if some posts _are_ controversial, then doesn't that inherently make them worth sharing in public? Why keep things in the dark, or talk about them in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_%28media%29" target="_blank">echo-chambers</a>?

<h3 id="faq-anon">Why not post anonymously?</h3>

If you know me, then you may be reading this in my voice, and you might even bring it up in person - both of which are kind of fun. If you do not know me, what difference does it make? No one is forced to read this garbage and if you made it this far down my FAQ page then I guess you are indeed curious! Oh, and if someone really did want to find me... They would.
